Hello! I’m Jane Pan, a fifth year PhD student in the Biostats department. I decided to become a member of the BSA after attending one of the board meetings and realizing how dedicated and committed everyone was in renewing the organization. I’m really looking forward to playing a part in upcoming events and help establish a sense of community within the program.
