Hi! I'm [Emilie Campos](http://emjcampos.netlify.com), a fourth year PhD student in the Biostat department. I joined BSA as the VP of Financial Affairs in 2019 and as Co-President with Crystal in 2020. I joined our student association because I felt that there were areas of improvement within our department and while conversations were happening among students and among faculty, there wasn't a clear bridge between the two groups. I hope to make a lasting impression within the department from which students can benefit for years to come. 

- Faculty advisor: Damla Senturk  
- Favorite restaurant in Westwood: Mr. Noodle  
- Non-academic hobbies: Knitting
