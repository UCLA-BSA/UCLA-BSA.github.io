Hi! I’m Ami Sheth, a second-year M.S student in the Biostat department. This is my first year on BSA and I am one of the Master’s Student Affairs Chair. I joined BSA to strengthen communication amongst Biostat students and faculty and improve within student relationships. I am excited to create plenty of opportunities for Masters and PhD students to interact in this upcoming year! 

I love to bake, watch reality tv (guilty pleasure), and hike. So if you’re ever need anything (academic or non-academic), feel free to contact me!
