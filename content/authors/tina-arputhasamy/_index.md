Hi! My name is Tina, and I’m entering my second year as a masters student in the Biostatistics department. I’m excited to start my first year as a Co-Chair of Master’s Affairs for BSA!

I joined BSA because I wanted to be a resource and mentor for incoming students. I also hope to help foster a stronger sense of community within our department through my role.

My hobbies are reading, playing the piano and playing video games. I’m also a Harry Potter nerd, ever so slightly obsessed with Shiba Inus and a chocolate lover.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need anything!
